# GTD Project Manager

This repository implements a Getting Things Done (GTD) project management system. The system is organized into the following areas:

## Directory Structure

- `inbox/`: Capture all incoming items, thoughts, and tasks
- `next-actions/`: Single, concrete next actions for each active project
- `projects/`: List of all active projects and their desired outcomes
- `project-plans/`: Detailed plans and supporting materials for projects
- `waiting-for/`: Items delegated to others or awaiting external events
- `someday-maybe/`: Future ideas and potential projects
- `reference/`: Project library and reference materials

## Usage

Follow the GTD workflow:
1. **Capture**: Add new items to the `inbox/` directory
2. **Clarify**: Process inbox items into appropriate directories
3. **Organize**: Maintain clear project structures and next actions
4. **Reflect**: Regular reviews of all areas
5. **Engage**: Execute on next actions
